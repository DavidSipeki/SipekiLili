      <p> Iâ€™m Lili Sipeki a third year fashion design student based in Cheshire. I am a creative and visionary
          designer, who specialises in womenswear and the production of commercial ranges focused
          towards the Premium market. I am practiced in developing cohesive and balanced multi product
          ranges (with great strengths in fabric manipulation) for collections from initial research through to
          final samples while demonstrating attuned attention to detail and inventive qualities. My design
          signature is highly creative, edgy and directional flavour, but with a sound appreciation of
          commercial marketability with a strong emphasis on fabric manipulation and detail.
